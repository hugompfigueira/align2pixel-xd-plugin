## Description

When creating a project in Adobe XD, I often face an issue (and you probably may too) that I can't control - **Pixel-Fractions**.

This annoying issue can be fixed by simply right-clicking and select "Align to Pixel Grid" or going to Object > Align to Pixel Grid. But if you are like me and rely heavily on **keyboard shortcuts (commands)**, this can become quite annoying and cumbersome, since Adobe XD doesn't allow you to create or edit existing shortcuts.

**Align 2 Pixel** is a lightweight plugin that allows you to quickly align the selected objects to the grid - as an integer instead of a fraction - using a quick command (see [Usage](https://github.com/hugompfigueira/align2pixel-xd-plugin/blob/main/README.md#usage) section). 

Until Adobe XD allows you to change or edit shortcuts, this plugin will come in handy to quickly perform an action that usually takes more than 2 clicks.

## Installation

To install this plugin, simply:

1. Download the file;
2. Go to Adobe XD, Plugins > Development > Show Develop Folder;
3. Extract the downloaded folder into the "develop" folder;
4. Go back to Adobe XD, Plugins > Development > Reload Plugins (or `Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + R`);
5. Done!

You will now see the Align 2 Pixel plugin in the plugins panel or in Plugins menu.

## Usage

To use this plugin, you have 3 options:

1. **Via commands (shortcuts)**: `Cmd + Shift + X` (or `Ctrl + Shift + X` if you are using Windows);
2. **Plugins panel**: You will see it in the Plugins panel (`Cmd + P` to show/hide panel) - click on it to apply action;
3. **Plugins menu**: You can also reach it in Plugins > Align2Pixel.

Now, simply **select one or multiple objects** you want to align to the Pixel Grig and then `Cmd + Shift + X`. Simple! 
The objects will adjust to the closest integer, making them sharp and Pixel-Perfect.

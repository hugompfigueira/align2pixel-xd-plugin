# Align 2 Pixel - Adobe XD Plugin

## Description

When creating a project in Adobe XD, I often face an issue (and you probably may too) that I can't control - pixel-fractions.

This annoying issue can be fixed by simply right-clicking and select "Align to Pixel Grid" or going to Object > Align to Pixel Grid. But if you are like me and rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts (commands), this can become quite annoying and cumbersome, since Adobe XD doesn't allow you to create or edit existing shortcuts.

**Align 2 Pixel** is a lightweight plugin that allows you to quickly align the selected objects to the grid - as an integer instead of a fraction. Until Adobe XD allows you to change or edit shortcuts, this plugin will come in handy to quickly perform an action that usually takes more than 2 clicks.

## Installation

To install this plugin, simply:

1. Download the file;
2. Go to Adobe XD, Plugins > Development > Show Development Folder;
3. Extract the downloaded folder into the "develop" folder;
4. Go back to Adobe XD, Plugins > Development > Reload Plugins (or Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + R);
5. Done!

You will now see the Align 2 Pixel plugin in the plugins panel or in Plugins menu.
